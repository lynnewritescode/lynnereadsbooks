***Before.***

*Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . . .*

***After.***

*Nothing is ever the same.*

I came across this book when one of my goodreads friends posted a review of it. I was looking for a short read and was intrigued by the premise. I'm glad I picked it up because it turned out to be a great read!

I really enjoyed this book for many reasons. The book follows an interesting pattern where it's split into two sections: **before** and **after**. Right from the start that tells us that some event happens around half way through the book. In the first half, each chapter is X number of days 'before', and the countdown definitely added an air of mystery to it. It's something I've never seen before and quite enjoyed that it was leading up to something.

Another thing I enjoyed was the style of writing. From the start, the writing is very clear and easy going which meant I couldn't put the book down. We see things from the viewpoint of Miles "Pudge" Halter, a teenager with not many friends who is about to head off to boarding school. That image can sometimes lead us to think we know what's going to happen, or what his boarding school experience might be like, but what I appreciated about this book was that it didn't do that. It didn't follow the standard story you would expect.

The friends he makes at the school are all very interesting characters, and some of the moments in the book were really funny. There was definitely a lot of fun moments throughout the book, and a lot of the 'before' section was lighthearted, but with a slightly darker undertone. Especially as it led up to the second half. We're seeing very young people questioning their place in the world and trying to find where they fit in.

To me, this book was charming, funny, heartwarming, and incredibly sad all at once. It's the kind of book that makes you feel, and there are many levels to it depending on how you choose to think about it. As I said before, I couldn't put the book down and I highly recommend it!

### Quote from the book

> “You spend your whole life stuck in the labyrinth, thinking about how you’ll escape it one day, and how awesome it will be, and imagining that future keeps you going, but you never do it. You just use the future to escape the present.”
