*In the world of The Binding, books are a taboo subject. People visit book binders to have their unwanted memories bound into a book and hidden away forever. Once their memories are bound into a book, they have no recollection of them anymore. The story follows Emmett Farmer, a boy who can no longer work on the farm he grew up on due to a recent illness, and is sent to live with a binder as her apprentice. One day he meets a customer of hers and senses an odd connection with him. Little does he know, that chance meeting would change his whole life.*

I first picked up this book in Waterstones in Glasgow. I had heard of the title, but had no idea what the book was about, or even what genre really. While wandering through the shop, it caught my eye. The beautiful front cover, with the purple edged pages. It drew me in, and after a quick read of the summary I thought, why not? I'll pick it up and see what it's like.

It took a while for me to get the premise and understand why people thought of books as a taboo subject. It's set in a world that is reminiscent of 19th-century England, and the only kind of fantasy element to the story is the concept of binding one's memories into a book. I enjoyed the setting and it wasn't too descriptive, which I liked. It left plenty of room for the imagination.

This book is very much about the characters, and I love good character development. Emmett Farmer is the main character, and although I liked him for the most part, there were definitely parts of him I didn't like. This is what I really enjoyed about the book, the characters had dimension. There were times when he would do something or say something stupid and I would feel frustrated about it. I felt like I was on a journey with him, and discovering things about his past alongside him.

The book kept me intrigued and wanting to know more. Around half way through the book, I reached the stage where I couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened next. There were twists and turns which kept me engaged throughout.

The writing was good and it took an interesting turn in the last third of the book where it switched to a different character's perspective entirely. Having seen things from Emmett Farmer's perspective up until that point, it was an interesting change. Personally I found this perspective slightly less enjoyable, however I feel like it was required and it showed that Bridget Collins had really fleshed out the characters. It was such a contrast, which showed how well the characters were written in this book.

I would consider the book to be a romance, even if it's not necessarily written in that way. Having no prior knowledge other than reading the cover, I was pleasantly surprised by this. It had a kind of underlying tension in the beginning and took a while for things to unfold (which some people don't enjoy or have the patience for), but I like that it took some time to get there and some aspects of the story hit very close to home.

Overall I really enjoyed the book and can safely say I've never read anything quite like it before. It was unique, whimsical, dark, well-written, and kept my attention throughout.
