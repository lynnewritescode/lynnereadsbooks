***Four hundred and eighty seconds. That’s how long it took for someone to steal Marin Machado's four-year-old son.***

*Marin had the perfect life. Married to her college sweetheart, she owns a chain of upscale hair salons, and Derek runs his own company. They're admired in their community and are a loving family. Up until the day Sebastian is taken.*

This novel starts with any parents' worst nightmare. In a busy market, Marin Machado let's go of her 4 year old son's hand for just a second and he was taken. The story unfolds from there, and the author does a good job of describing the shock, panic, anger, grief, and a million other emotions that you must be feeling in that moment and the following weeks and months.

After the kidnapping, we see that it has affected Marin and Derek's relationship in a big way. Unfortunately, the story then focuses on that for a large part of the book and although ultimately it's still about what happened to her son, that seems to take a backseat for a while.

I struggled with this review a little, because I had heard very good things about this book and had high expectations going in. The author was very good at getting across the characters emotions, and the story itself was interesting enough that I couldn't really put the book down. I wanted to find out what happened next. So although I didn’t feel a huge connection with the characters, I did want to follow the story and see where it went.

There were some twists and turns but I felt like I knew what was coming most of the time, and connected the dots pretty quickly. The conclusion that I suspected early on is what happened after all, and I don’t feel like there was an attempt to lead you down any other road in terms of suspects, which I found disappointing.

I read this book very quickly (in just one day), so it clearly held my attention, and if you like books of this genre, or a quick holiday read then I'm sure it will be enjoyable. Personally, I liked it but I was just too disappointed with the ending and had hoped for a bit more of a shock factor or a few more surprises along the way.
